            <h2>About Pitstop</h2>
            <p>
                Pitstop is a model car dealership company designed by me, Rohan Raval.
                It was developed as an internship project for Revature, Inc.
                The idea of the website is to present auto buyers with data about available
                cars in the local area so they can make a purchase. <br />
                I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front-end design and
                functionality of these pages. <br /> Additional technologies such as jQuery,
                AJAX and JSON were implemented to improve and add functionalities such as the
                Vehicle Browser, which allows users to select from available vehicles. Information
                about these vehicles is currently stored as a .txt file, and parsed in as a JSON object.<br /><br />
                Ongoing revisions on the project include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of a proper database structure to store and retrieve inventory
                    data using MySQL and PHP.</li>
                <li>Addition of login and sign-up features for customers, wherein customers
                    can add cars to their individual favorites list. </li>
                <li>Functionality for sellers to add their cars to the inventory database,
                    with proper authentication.</li>
            </ul>
